# jupyter-meeting

On **Tuesday August 8th, 2017** we are planning to hold a meeting of people interested in using Jupyter in their research and teaching. The main focus of the discussion will be the syzygy.ca service which provides Jupyter notebooks to people at Canadian educational and research institutions. We will cover existing uses of Jupyter, including lessons learned and problems encountered and we will be discussing possible next directions for the service.'
